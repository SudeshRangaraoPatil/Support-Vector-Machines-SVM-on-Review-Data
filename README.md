This Python script implements sentiment analysis using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on a review dataset. The script preprocesses the text data by tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatization. It then uses TF-IDF vectorization to transform the text data into numerical features. The SVM classifier is trained on the TF-IDF vectors to classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the presence of polarity words. Finally, the script evaluates the accuracy of the classifier and provides an example of predicting sentiment for new documents.
